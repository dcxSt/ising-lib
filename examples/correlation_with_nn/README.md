Nearest Neighbour correlations are computed and saved to CSV file for further analysis (for instance with a scripting language like python / jupyter notebooks).  

## Quick start

`cargo run --release`

TODO: mathjax? find some way to display equations for NN correlation score that is implemented in the measurment...

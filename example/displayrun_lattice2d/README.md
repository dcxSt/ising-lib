:warning: The config file `Cargo.toml` uses `ising_lib` as a local dependency. Once version `^1.0.0` of `ising_lib` is published to [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/ising_lib) the following config options
```toml
[dependencies.ising_lib]
path = "../../"
```
should be changed to 
```toml
[dependencies]
ising_lib = "1.0.0"
```

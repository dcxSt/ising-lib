[2] [Ising Model of User Behavior Decision in Network Rumor Propagation](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ddns/2018/5207475/). Discusses a use of ising models for rumour propagation. Uses 2d ising lattice for simulations. Interaction forces have three terms, the 'micropart' or 'self identity attribute', the 'middle part' or 'user-user interaction' (i.e. interaction constant `J`), the 'macroscopic part' or 'social enviornment's influence' (i.e. ext mag field `H`). Concepts include Von Neuman entropy, Game theory.
